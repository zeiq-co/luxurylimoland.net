    "readme": "# extract-zip\n\nUnzip written in pure JavaScript. Extracts a zip into a directory. Available as a library or a command line program.\n\nUses the [`yauzl`](http://npmjs.org/yauzl) ZIP parser.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/extract-zip.png?global=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/extract-zip/)\n[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxogden/extract-zip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxogden/extract-zip)\n\n## Installation\n\nGet the library:\n\n```\nnpm install extract-zip --save\n```\n\nInstall the command line program:\n\n```\nnpm install extract-zip -g\n```\n\n## JS API\n\n```js\nvar extract = require('extract-zip')\nextract(source, {dir: target}, function (err) {\n // extraction is complete. make sure to handle the err\n})\n```\n\n### Options\n\n- `dir` - defaults to `process.cwd()`\n- `defaultDirMode` - integer - Directory Mode (permissions) will default to `493` (octal `0755` in integer)\n- `defaultFileMode` - integer - File Mode (permissions) will default to `420` (octal `0644` in integer)\n- `onEntry` - function - if present, will be called with `(entry, zipfile)`, entry is every entry from the zip file forwarded from the `entry` event from yauzl. `zipfile` is the `yauzl` instance\n\nDefault modes are only used if no permissions are set in the zip file.\n\n## CLI Usage\n\n```\nextract-zip foo.zip <targetDirectory>\n```\n\nIf not specified, `targetDirectory` will default to `process.cwd()`.\n",
