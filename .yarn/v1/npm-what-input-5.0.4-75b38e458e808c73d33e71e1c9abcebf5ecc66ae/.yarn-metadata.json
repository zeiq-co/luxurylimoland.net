    "readme": "# What Input?\n\n__A global utility for tracking the current input method (mouse, keyboard or touch).__\n\n## What Input is now v5\n\nNow with more information and less opinion!\n\nWhat Input adds data attributes to the `window` based on the type of input being used. It also exposes a simple API that can be used for scripting interactions.\n\n## How it works\n\nWhat Input uses event bubbling on the `window` to watch for mouse, keyboard and touch events (via `mousedown`, `keydown` and `touchstart`). It then sets or updates a `data-whatinput` attribute.\n\nPointer Events are supported but note that `pen` inputs are remapped to `touch`.\n\nWhat Input also exposes a tiny API that allows the developer to ask for the current input, set custom ignore keys, and set and remove custom callback functions.\n\n_What Input does not make assumptions about the input environment before the page is interacted with._ However, the `mousemove` and `pointermove` events are used to set a `data-whatintent=\"mouse\"` attribute to indicate that a mouse is being used _indirectly_.\n\n## Demo\n\nCheck out the demo to see What Input in action.\n\nhttps://ten1seven.github.io/what-input\n\n### Interacting with Forms\n\nSince interacting with a form _always_ requires use of the keyboard, What Input uses the `data-whatintent` attribute to display a \"buffered\" version of input events while form `<input>`s, `<select>`s, and `<textarea>`s are being interacted with (i.e. mouse user's `data-whatintent` will be preserved as `mouse` while typing).\n\n## Installing\n\nDownload the file directly.\n\nInstall via Yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn add what-input\n```\n\nInstall via NPM:\n\n```shell\nnpm install what-input\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nInclude the script directly in your project.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/what-input.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOr require with a script loader.\n\n```javascript\nimport 'what-input'\n\n// or\n\nimport whatInput from 'what-input'\n\n// or\n\nrequire('what-input')\n\n// or\n\nvar whatInput = require('what-input')\n\n// or\n\nrequirejs.config({\n  paths: {\n    whatInput: 'path/to/what-input'\n  }\n})\n\nrequire(['whatInput'], function() {})\n```\n\nWhat Input will start doing its thing while you do yours.\n\n### Basic Styling\n\n```css\n/*\n * only suppress the focus ring once what-input has successfully started\n */\n\n/* suppress focus ring on form controls for mouse users */\n[data-whatintent=\"mouse\"] *:focus {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n**Note:** If you remove outlines with `outline: none;`, be sure to provide clear visual `:focus` styles so the user can see which element they are on at any time for greater accessibility. Visit [W3C's WCAG 2.0 2.4.7 Guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html) to learn more.\n\n### Scripting\n\n#### Current Input\n\nAsk What Input what the current input method is. This works best if asked after the events What Input is bound to (`mousedown`, `keydown` and `touchstart`).\n\n```javascript\nwhatInput.ask() // returns `mouse`, `keyboard` or `touch`\n\nmyButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  if (whatInput.ask() === 'mouse') {\n    // do mousy things\n  } else if (whatInput.ask() === 'keyboard') {\n    // do keyboard things\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIf it's necessary to know if `mousemove` is being used, use the `'intent'` option. For example:\n\n```javascript\n\n/*\n * nothing has happened but the mouse has moved\n */\n\nwhatInput.ask() // returns `initial` because the page has not been directly interacted with\nwhatInput.ask('intent') // returns `mouse` because mouse movement was detected\n\n/*\n * the keyboard has been used, then the mouse was moved\n */\n\nwhatInput.ask() // returns `keyboard` because the keyboard was the last direct page interaction\nwhatInput.ask('intent') // returns `mouse` because mouse movement was the most recent action detected\n```\n\n### Current Element\n\nAsk What Input the currently focused DOM element.\n\n```javascript\nwhatInput.element() // returns a string, like `input` or null\n```\n\n#### Ignore Keys\n\nSet a custom array of [keycodes](http://keycode.info/) that will be ignored (will not switch over to `keyboard`) when pressed. _A custom list will overwrite the default values._\n\n```javascript\n/*\n * default ignored keys:\n * 16, // shift\n * 17, // control\n * 18, // alt\n * 91, // Windows key / left Apple cmd\n * 93  // Windows menu / right Apple cmd\n */\n\nwhatInput.ignoreKeys([1, 2, 3])\n```\n\n#### Custom Callbacks\n\nFire a function when the input or intent changes.\n\n```javascript\n// create a function to be fired\nvar myFunction = function(type) {\n  console.log(type)\n};\n\n// fire `myFunction` when the intent changes\nwhatInput.registerOnChange(myFunction, 'intent');\n\n// fire `myFunction` when the input changes\nwhatInput.registerOnChange(myFunction, 'input');\n\n// remove custom event\nwhatInput.unRegisterOnChange(myFunction);\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nWhat Input works in all modern browsers. For compatibility with IE8, polyfills are required for:\n\n* addEventListener\n* IndexOf\n\nAdd your own, or grab the bundle included here.\n\n```html\n<!--[if lte IE 8]>\n  <script src=\"lte-IE8.js\"></script>\n<![endif]-->\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v5.0.3\n\n* __Fixed:__ Event buffer for touch was not working correctly.\n\n### Changes from v4\n\n* __Added:__ A the ability to add and remove custom callback function when the input or intent changes with `whatInput.registerOnChange` and `whatInput.unRegisterOnChange`.\n* __Added:__ A `data-whatelement` attribute exposes any currently focused DOM element (i.e. `data-whatelement=\"a\"` or `data-whatelement=\"input\"`).\n* __Added:__ A `data-whatclasses` attribute exposes any currently focused element's classes as a comma-separated list (i.e. `data-whatclasses=\"class1,class2\"`).\n* __Added:__ An API option to provide a custom array of keycodes that will be ignored.\n* __Changed:__ Typing in form fields is no longer filtered out. The `data-whatinput` attribute immediately reflects the current input. The `data-whatintent` attribute now takes on the role of remembering mouse input prior to typing in or clicking on a form field.\n* __Changed:__ If you use the Tab key to move from one input to another one - the `data-whatinput` attribute reflects the current input (switches to \"keyboard\").\n* __Removed:__ `whatInput.types()` API option.\n* __Removed:__ Bower support.\n* __Fixed:__ Using mouse modifier keys (`shift`, `control`, `alt`, `cmd`) no longer toggles back to keyboard.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSpecial thanks to [Viget](http://viget.com/) for their encouragement and commitment to open source projects.
