Find resources [from the community](http://graphql.org/community/).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAn overview of GraphQL in general is available in the\n[README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the\n[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql). That overview\ndescribes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](src/__tests__)\nin this repository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk\nthrough that README and the corresponding tests in parallel.\n\n### Using GraphQL.js\n\nInstall GraphQL.js from npm\n\nWith yarn:\n\n```sh\nyarn add graphql\n```\n\nor alternatively using npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save graphql\n```\n\nGraphQL.js provides two important capabilities: building a type schema, and\nserving queries against that type schema.\n\nFirst, build a GraphQL type schema which maps to your code base.\n\n```js\nimport {\n  graphql,\n  GraphQLSchema,\n  GraphQLObjectType,\n  GraphQLString\n} from 'graphql';\n\nvar schema = new GraphQLSchema({\n  query: new GraphQLObjectType({\n    name: 'RootQueryType',\n    fields: {\n      hello: {\n        type: GraphQLString,\n        resolve() {\n          return 'world';\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThis defines a simple schema with one type and one field, that resolves\nto a fixed value. The `resolve` function can return a value, a promise,\nor an array of promises. A more complex example is included in the top\nlevel [tests](src/__tests__) directory.\n\nThen, serve the result of a query against that type schema.\n\n```js\nvar query = '{ hello }';\n\ngraphql(schema, query).then(result => {\n\n  // Prints\n  // {\n  //   data: { hello: \"world\" }\n  // }\n  console.log(result);\n\n});\n```\n\nThis runs a query fetching the one field defined. The `graphql` function will\nfirst ensure the query is syntactically and semantically valid before executing\nit, reporting errors otherwise.\n\n```js\nvar query = '{ boyhowdy }';\n\ngraphql(schema, query).then(result => {\n\n  // Prints\n  // {\n  //   errors: [\n  //     { message: 'Cannot query field boyhowdy on RootQueryType',\n  //       locations: [ { line: 1, column: 3 } ] }\n  //   ]\n  // }\n  console.log(result);\n\n});\n```\n\n### Want to ride the bleeding edge?\n\nThe `npm` branch in this repository is automatically maintained to be the last\ncommit to `master` to pass all tests, in the same form found on npm. It is\nrecommend to use builds deployed npm for many reasons, but if you want to use\nthe latest not-yet-released version of graphql-js, you can do so by depending\ndirectly on this branch:\n\n```\nnpm install graphql@git://github.com/graphql/graphql-js.git#npm\n```\n\n### Contributing\n\nWe actively welcome pull requests, learn how to\n[contribute](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Changelog\n\nChanges are tracked as [GitHub releases](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/releases).\n\n### License\n\nGraphQL.js is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/LICENSE).\n",
