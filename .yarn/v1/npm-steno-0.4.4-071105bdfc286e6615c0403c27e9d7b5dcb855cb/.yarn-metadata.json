    "readme": "# steno [![](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/steno.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/steno)  [![](https://travis-ci.org/typicode/steno.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/typicode/steno)\n\n> Simple file writer with __atomic writing__ and __race condition prevention__.\n\nCan be used as a drop-in replacement to `fs.writeFile()`.\n\nBuilt on [graceful-fs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) and used in [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install steno --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst steno = require('steno')\n\nsteno.writeFile('file.json', data, err => {\n  if (err) throw err\n})\n```\n\n## The problem it solves\n\n### Without steno\n\nLet's say you have a server and want to save data to disk:\n\n```javascript\nvar data = { counter: 0 }\n\nserver.post('/', (req, res) => {\n  // Increment counter\n  ++data.counter\n\n  // Save data asynchronously\n  fs.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), err => {\n    if (err) throw err\n    res.end()\n  })\n})\n```\n\nNow if you have many requests, for example `1000`, there's a risk that you end up with:\n\n```javascript\n// In your server\ndata.counter === 1000\n\n// In data.json\ndata.counter === 865 // ... or any other value\n```\n\nWhy? Because, `fs.write` doesn't guarantee that the call order will be kept. Also, if the server is killed while `data.json` is being written, the file can get corrupted.\n\n### With steno\n\n```javascript\nserver.post('/increment', (req, res) => {\n  ++data.counter\n\n  steno.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), err => {\n    if (err) throw err\n    res.end()\n  })\n})\n```\n\nWith steno you'll always have the same data in your server and file. And in case of a crash, file integrity will be preserved.\n\nif needed, you can also use `steno.writeFileSync()` which offers atomic writing too.\n\n__Important: works only in a single instance of Node.__\n\n## License\n\nMIT - [Typicode](https://github.com/typicode)\n",
