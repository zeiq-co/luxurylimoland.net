This package provides a [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) object schema for webpack configs. This gets you a) static type safety, b) property spell checking and c) semantic validations such as \"`loader` and `loaders` can not be used simultaneously\" or \"`query` can only be used with `loader`, not with `loaders`\".\n\nYou're very welcome to give [feedback](https://github.com/js-dxtools/webpack-validator/issues) & [PR's](https://github.com/js-dxtools/webpack-validator).\n\n**Note: webpack v2 has built-in validation for configuration. Due to this, `webpack-validator` is unlikely to make significant changes. While pull requests will be reviewed and can be merged, project maintainers are unlikely to put a lot of much effort into the maintenance of the project.**\n\n### Example\nTake this simple webpack config. It has a tiny, hard to spot error. Can you find it?\n```js\nvar config = {\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      { test: /\\.js$/, loaders: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ }\n    ]\n  },\n  output: {\n    library: 'Redux',\n    libraryTarget: 'umd'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(env)\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nwebpack-validator makes it easy:\n\n![validation-example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3755413/14134087/b3279738-f654-11e5-9752-367b01ac123d.png)\n\n### Usage\nThere are two ways to use webpack-validator: a) \"programmatically\" by wrapping your webpack config object with a validation function or b) by using a command line interface.\n\nFor the first approach, add this in your `webpack.config.js`:\n```js\nconst validate = require('webpack-validator');\n\nmodule.exports = validate({ /* ... your webpack config */ });\n```\nNow run webpack. Either everything is green and the build continues or `joi` will let you know what's wrong and the build won't continue.\n\nIf your webpack config is an array of configs instead of a single object, the above doesn't quite work. Add this in your `webpack.config.js` instead:\n```js\nconst validate = require('webpack-validator').validateRoot;\n\nmodule.exports = validate({ /* ... your webpack config */ });\n```\n\n#### CLI\nFor CLI usage you probably want to install the tool globally (`npm install -g webpack-validator`) first. Then just run `webpack-validator <your-config>`.\n\n### Customizing\n#### Schema\nIf you need to extend the schema, for example for custom top level properties or properties added by third party plugins like `eslint-loader` (which adds a toplevel `eslint` property), do it like this:\n\n```js\nconst validate = require('webpack-validator')\nconst Joi = require('webpack-validator').Joi\n\n// This joi schema will be `Joi.concat`-ed with the internal schema\nconst yourSchemaExtension = Joi.object({\n  // this would just allow the property and doesn't perform any additional validation\n  eslint: Joi.any()\n})\n\nconst config = { /* ... your webpack config */ }\n\nmodule.exports = validate(config, { schemaExtension: yourSchemaExtension })\n```\n\n#### Rules\nSome validations do more than just validating your data shape, they check for best practices and do \"more\" which you might want to opt out of / in to. This is an overview of the available rules (we just started with this, this list will grow :)):\n- **no-root-files-node-modules-nameclash** (default: true): this checks that files/folders that are found in directories specified via webpacks `resolve.root` option do not nameclash with `node_modules` packages. This prevents nasty path resolving bugs (for a motivating example, have a look at [this redux issue](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1681)).\n- **loader-enforce-include-or-exclude** (default: false): enforce that [loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#module-loaders) objects use `include` or/and `exclude`, throw when neither is supplied. Without supplying one of these conditions it is too easy to process too many files, for example your `node_modules` folder.\n- **loader-prefer-include** (default: false): enforce that [loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#module-loaders) objects use `include` and not `exclude`. `exclude` makes it easy to match too many files, which might inadvertently slow your build down.\n\nYou opt in/out of rules by using the `rules` option:\n```js\nmodule.exports = validate(config, {\n  rules: {\n    'no-root-files-node-modules-nameclash': false,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n**Note**: This is not yet implemented via cli options, the default rules will apply in that case.\n\n#### Quiet Mode\nIf you want to mute console output apart from errors, set `--quiet` (`-q`) or `validate(config, { quiet: true })`. This is particularly useful if you are using webpack `--json` as you'll want to avoid writing additional text to the JSON output.\n\n#### Validate all **package.json** `scripts`\nIt is possible to use the CLI to validate all your **package.json** `scripts` related configurations at once by using `--all-scripts` (`-a`). The system will try to guess the convention you are using and then executes validation against each script target based on that.\n\n#### Advanced Usage\nIf you need to access the validation results directly and want to control the side-effects (i.e. console.log output, `process.exit(1)` on fail behaviour) yourself, you can call the validation function like so: `validate(config, { returnValidation: true })`. This will make 1) the function return the validation results instead of your configuration and 2) not perform any side effects.\n\n#### Support\nBecause this module uses the amazing `Joi` validation library, this module only supports Node >=4.0.0.\n\n#### License\nMIT\n",
