Focus will move to the first item that starts with the letter you typed; but if you continue to type more letters, the search string extends and the focus becomes more accurate.\n\nSo if you type `f` focus might arrive at `farm`; but then if you keep typing until you've typed `foo`, focus will skip ahead (past `farm` and `fit` and `fog`) to `foot`. This significantly improves your ability to type your way to your intended selection.\n\nThis keyboard interaction (as well as the arrow keys) is enabled by the module [focus-group](//github.com/davidtheclark/focus-group). You can read more about the way letter navigation works [in that documentation](//github.com/davidtheclark/focus-group#string-searching).\n\n(In 3.x.x, when you typed a letter key focus moved to the next item in the menu (i.e. after the current focused item) that started with that letter, looping around to the front if if reached the end. This was more or less the suggested behavior from the ARIA suggestion and what I saw in jQuery UI. But I think the UX was insufficient, so when I separated out the letter navigation into the module [focus-group](//github.com/davidtheclark/focus-group), I tried to *improve letter navigation by more closely mimicking native `<select>` menus.)\n\nPlease file an issue if anything is unclear or doesn't work as expected.\n\n### Flexibility and minimal styling\n\nInstead of providing a pre-fabricated, fully styled widget, this module's goal is to provide a set of components that others can build their own stuff on top of.\n\nIt does not provide any classes or a stylesheet that you'll have to figure out how to include; and it does not include inline styles that would be hard to override. It **only provides \"smart\" components to wrap your (dumb, styled) components**. The *library's* components take care of keyboard interaction and ARIA attributes, while *your* components just do whatever you want your components to do.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install react-aria-menubutton\n```\n\nThe modular approach of this library means you're much better off building it into your code with a module bundling system like browserify or webpack.\n\nBut if you need a UMD version (which will include `focus-group` and `teeny-tap` in the bundle, but of course not `React` or `ReactDOM`), you can get it via npmcdm at `https://unpkg.com/react-aria-menubutton@[version-of-choice]/umd/ReactAriaMenuButton.js`.\nIf you don't know about unpkg, [read about it here](https://unpkg.com).\n\n## Browser Support\n\nBasically IE9+.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst AriaMenuButton = require('react-aria-menubutton');\n\n// Now use AriaMenuButton.Wrapper, AriaMenuButton.Button,\n// AriaMenuButton.Menu, and AriaMenuButton.MenuItem ...\n\n// ... or with es2015\nimport { Button, Wrapper, Menu, MenuItem } from 'react-aria-menubutton';\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nFor details about why the examples work, read the API documentation below.\n\nYou can also see more examples by looking in `demo/`.\n\n```js\n// Very simple ES2015 example\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Wrapper, Button, Menu, MenuItem } from 'react-aria-menubutton';\n\nconst menuItemWords = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];\n\nclass MyMenuButton extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const menuItems = menuItemWords.map((word, i) => {\n      return (\n        <li key={i}>\n          <MenuItem className='MyMenuButton-menuItem'>\n            {word}\n          </MenuItem>\n        </li>\n      );\n    });\n\n    return (\n      <Wrapper\n        className='MyMenuButton'\n        onSelection={handleSelection}\n      >\n        <Button className='MyMenuButton-button'>\n          click me\n        </Button>\n        <Menu className='MyMenuButton-menu'>\n          <ul>{menuItems}</ul>\n        </Menu>\n      </Wrapper>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction handleSelection(value, event) { .. }\n```\n\n```js\n// Slightly more complex, ES5 example:\n// - MenuItems have hidden values that are passed\n//   to the selection handler\n// - User can navigate the MenuItems by typing the\n//   first letter of a person's name, even though\n//   each MenuItem's child is not simple text\n// - Menu has a function for a child\n// - React's CSSTransitionGroup is used for open-close animation\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar CSSTransitionGroup = require('react-transition-group/CSSTransitionGroup');\nvar AriaMenuButton = require('react-aria-menubutton');\n\nvar people = [{\n  name: 'Charles Choo-Choo',\n  id: 1242\n}, {\n  name: 'Mina Meowmers',\n  id: 8372\n}, {\n  name: 'Susan Sailor',\n  id: 2435\n}];\n\nvar MyMenuButton = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    var peopleMenuItems = people.map(function(person, i) {\n      return (\n        <AriaMenuButton.MenuItem\n          key={i}\n          tag='li'\n          value={person.id}\n          text={person.name}\n          className='PeopleMenu-person'\n        >\n          <div className='PeopleMenu-personPhoto'>\n            <img src={'/people/pictures/' + person.id + '.jpg'}/ >\n          </div>\n          <div className='PeopleMenu-personName'>\n            {person.name}\n          </div>\n        </AriaMenuButton.MenuItem>\n      );\n    });\n\n    var peopleMenuInnards = function(menuState) {\n      var menu = (!menuState.isOpen) ? false : (\n        <div\n          className='PeopleMenu-menu'\n          key='menu'\n        >\n          {peopleMenuItems}\n        </div>\n      );\n      return (\n        <CSSTransitionGroup transitionName='people'>\n          {menu}\n        </CSSTransitionGroup>\n      );\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <AriaMenuButton.Wrapper\n        className='PeopleMenu'\n        onSelection={handleSelection}\n        style={{ marginTop: 20 }}\n      >\n        <AriaMenuButton.Button className='PeopleMenu-trigger'>\n          <span className='PeopleMenu-triggerText'>\n            Select a person\n          </span>\n          <span className='PeopleMenu-triggerIcon' />\n        </AriaMenuButton.Button>\n        <AriaMenuButton.Menu>\n          {peopleMenuInnards}\n        </AriaMenuButton.Menu>\n      </AriaMenuButton.Wrapper>\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nfunction handleSelection(value, event) { .. }\n```\n\n## API\n\nThe module exposes four components: `Wrapper`, `Button`, `Menu`, and `MenuItem`. Each of these is documented below.\n\n**`Button`, `Menu`, and `MenuItem` must always be wrapped in a `Wrapper`.**\n\n### `Wrapper`\n\nA simple component to group a `Button`/`Menu`/`MenuItem` set, coordinating their interactions.\n*It should wrap your entire menu button widget.*\n\nAll `Button`, `Menu`, and `MenuItem` components *must* be nested within a `Wrapper` component.\n\nEach wrapper can contain *only one* `Button`, *only one* `Menu`, and *multiple* `MenuItem`s.\n\n#### props\n\nAll props are optional.\n\n**onSelection** { Function }: A callback to run when the user makes a selection (i.e. clicks or presses Enter or Space on a `MenuItem`). It will be passed the `value` of the selected `MenuItem` and the React SyntheticEvent. *You should definitely use this prop, unless your menu items are anchor elements.*\n\n```js\n<Wrapper onSelection={handleSelection} />\n\n// ...\n\nfunction handleSelection(value, event) {\n  event.stopPropagation;\n  console.log(value);\n}\n```\n\n**onMenuToggle** { Function }: A callback to run when the menu is opened or closed. It will be passed the the following menu-state object:\n\n```js\n{\n  isOpen: Boolean // whether or not the menu is open\n}\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nconst Example extends React.PureComponent {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = {\n      isOpen: false,\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const openClass = this.state.isOpen ? 'open' : '';\n\n    return (\n      <Wrapper\n        className={`${openClass}`}\n        onMenuToggle={({ isOpen }) => { this.setState({ isOpen })}}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**closeOnSelection** { Boolean }: By default, it *does* automatically close. If `false`, the menu will *not* automatically close when a selection is made. Default: `true`.\n\n**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'div'`.\n\n### `Button`\n\nA React component to wrap the content of your menu-button-pattern's button.\n\nThe `Button` component itself acts as a UI button (with tab-index, role, etc.), so you probably do not want to pass an HTML `<button>` element as its child.\n\nEach `Button` must be wrapped in a `Wrapper`, and each `Wrapper` can wrap only one `Button`.\n\n#### props\n\nAll props are optional.\n\n**disabled** { Boolean }: If `true`, the element is disabled (`aria-disabled='true'`, not in tab order, clicking has no effect).\n\n**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'span'` so styling across browsers is consistent, `button` is a good alternative if styling for that element is no issue.\n\n*Any additional props (e.g. `id`, `className`, `data-whatever`) are passed directly to the HTML element.*\n\n### `Menu`\n\nA React component to wrap the content of your menu-button-pattern's menu.\n\nA `Menu`'s child may be one of the following:\n\n- a React element, which will mount when the menu is open and unmount when the menu closes\n- a function accepting the following menu-state object\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    isOpen: Boolean // whether or not the menu is open\n  }\n  ```\n\nEach `Menu` must be wrapped in a `Wrapper`, and each `Wrapper` can wrap only one `Menu`.\n\n#### props\n\nAll props are optional.\n\n**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'span'`.\n\n*Any additional props (e.g. `id`, `className`, `data-whatever`) are passed directly to the HTML element.*\n\n### `MenuItem`\n\nA React component to wrap the content of one of your menu-button-pattern's menu items.\n\nEach `MenuItem` must be wrapped in a `Wrapper`, and each `Wrapper` can wrap multiple `MenuItem`s.\n\nWhen a `MenuItem` is *selected* (by clicking or focusing and hitting Enter or Space), it calls the `onSelection` handler you passed `ariaMenuButton` when creating this set of components.\n\nIt passes that handler a *value* and the *event*. The value it passes is determined as follows:\n\n- If the `MenuItem` has a `value` prop, that is passed.\n- If the `MenuItem` has no `value` prop, the component's child is passed (so it better be simple text!).\n\nWhen the menu is open and the user hits a letter key, focus moves to the next `MenuItem` whose \"text\" starts with that letter. The `MenuItem`'s relevant \"text\" is determined as follows:\n\n- If the `MenuItem` has a `text` prop, that is used.\n- If the `MenuItem` has no `text` prop, the component's child is used (so it better be simple text!).\n\n#### props\n\nAll props are optional.\n\n**text** { String } *Required if child is an element*: If `text` has a value, its first letter will be the letter a user can type to navigate to that item.\n\n**value** { String | Boolean | Number }: *Required if child is an element.* If `value` has a value, it will be passed to the `onSelection` handler when the `MenuItem` is selected.\n\n**tag** { String }: The HTML tag for this element. Default: `'span'`.\n\n*Any additional props (e.g. `id`, `className`, `data-whatever`) are passed directly to the DOM element.*\n\n### openMenu(wrapperId[, openOptions])\n\nOpen a modal programmatically.\n\n*For this to work, you must provide an `id` prop to the `Wrapper` of the menu.* That `id` should be your first argument to `openMenu()`.\n\nThese are the `openOptions`:\n\n- **focusMenu** { Boolean }: If `true`, the menu's first item will receive focus when the menu opens. Default: `true`.\n\n### closeMenu(wrapperId[, closeOptions])\n\nClose a modal programmatically.\n\n*For this to work, you must provide an `id` prop to the `Wrapper` of the menu.* That `id` should be your first argument to `closeMenu()`.\n\nThese are the `closeOptions`:\n\n- **focusButton** { Boolean }: If `true`, the widget's button will receive focus when the menu closes. Default: `false`.\n\n## Contributing & Development\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.
