Edge does not have any\nproblems with the `classList` property for SVG elements). If your code relies on\nclassList in any way, you want to use a polyfill like\n[dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4).\n\nThis HOC supports stateless components as of v5.7.0, and switched to using\ntranspiled es6 classes rather than `createClass` as of v6.\n\n## Sections covered in this README\n\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Regulate which events to listen for](#regulate-which-events-to-listen-for)\n* [Regulate whether or not to listen for outside clicks](#regulate-whether-or-not-to-listen-for-outside-clicks)\n* [Regulate whether or not to listen to scrollbar clicks](#regulate-whether-or-not-to-listen-to-scrollbar-clicks)\n* [Regulating `evt.preventDefault()` and `evt.stopPropagation()`](#regulating-evtpreventdefault-and-evtstoppropagation)\n* [Marking elements as \"skip over this one\" during the event loop](#marking-elements-as-skip-over-this-one-during-the-event-loop)\n* [Older React code: \"What happened to the Mixin??\"](#older-react-code-what-happened-to-the-mixin)\n  * [But how can I access my component?

You then use it in your components\nas:\n\n```js\n// ES6 Class and Module Syntax\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport onClickOutside from \"react-onclickoutside\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  handleClickOutside = evt => {\n    // ..handling code goes here...\n  };\n}\n\nexport default onClickOutside(MyComponent);\n```\n\nor:\n\n```js\n// good old node.js/CommonJS require\n// .default is needed because library is bundled as ES6 module\nvar onClickOutside = require(\"react-onclickoutside\").default;\nvar createReactClass = require(\"create-react-class\");\n\n// create a new component, wrapped by this onclickoutside HOC:\nvar MyComponent = onClickOutside(\n  createReactClass({\n    // ...,\n    handleClickOutside: function(evt) {\n      // ...handling code goes here...\n    }\n    // ...\n  })\n);\n```\n\nNote that if you try to wrap a React component class without a\n`handleClickOutside(evt)` handler like this, the HOC will throw an error. In\norder to use a custom event handler, you can specify the function to be used by\nthe HOC as second parameter (this can be useful in environments like TypeScript,\nwhere the fact that the wrapped component does not implement the handler can be\nflagged at compile-time):\n\n```js\n// load the HOC:\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport onClickOutside from \"react-onclickoutside\";\n\n// create a new component, wrapped below by onClickOutside HOC:\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  // ...\n  myClickOutsideHandler(evt) {\n    // ...handling code goes here...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\nvar clickOutsideConfig = {\n  handleClickOutside: function(instance) {\n    return instance.myClickOutsideHandler;\n  }\n};\nvar EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);\n```\n\nNote that if you try to wrap a React component with a custom handler that the\ncomponent does not implement, the HOC will throw an error at run-time.\n\n## Regulate which events to listen for\n\nBy default, \"outside clicks\" are based on both `mousedown` and `touchstart`\nevents; if that is what you need, then you do not need to specify anything\nspecial. However, if you need different events, you can specify these using the\n`eventTypes` property. If you just need one event, you can pass in the event\nname as plain string:\n\n```js\n<MyComponent eventTypes=\"click\" ... />\n```\n\nFor multiple events, you can pass in the array of event names you need to listen\nfor:\n\n```js\n<MyComponent eventTypes={[\"click\", \"touchend\"]} ... />\n```\n\n## Regulate whether or not to listen for outside clicks\n\nWrapped components have two functions that can be used to explicitly listen for,\nor do nothing with, outside clicks\n\n* `enableOnClickOutside()` - Enables outside click listening by setting up the\n  event listening bindings.\n* `disableOnClickOutside()` - Disables outside click listening by explicitly\n  removing the event listening bindings.\n\nIn addition, you can create a component that uses this HOC such that it has the\ncode set up and ready to go, but not listening for outside click events until\nyou explicitly issue its `enableOnClickOutside()`, by passing in a properly\ncalled `disableOnClickOutside`:\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport onClickOutside from \"react-onclickoutside\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  // ...\n  handleClickOutside(evt) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\nvar EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);\n\nclass Container extends Component {\n  render(evt) {\n    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} />;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing `disableOnClickOutside()` or `enableOnClickOutside()` within\n`componentDidMount` or `componentWillMount` is considered an anti-pattern, and\ndoes not have consistent behaviour when using the mixin and HOC/ES7 Decorator.\nFavour setting the `disableOnClickOutside` property on the component.\n\n## Regulate whether or not to listen to scrollbar clicks\n\nBy default this HOC will listen for \"clicks inside the document\", which may\ninclude clicks that occur on the scrollbar. Quite often clicking on the\nscrollbar _should_ close whatever is open but in case your project invalidates\nthat assumption you can use the `excludeScrollbar` property to explicitly tell\nthe HOC that clicks on the scrollbar should be ignored:\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport onClickOutside from \"react-onclickoutside\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  // ...\n}\nvar EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);\n\nclass Container extends Component {\n  render(evt) {\n    return <EnhancedComponent excludeScrollbar={true} />;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can specify this behavior as default for all instances of\nyour component passing a configuration object as second parameter:\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport onClickOutside from \"react-onclickoutside\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  // ...\n}\nvar clickOutsideConfig = {\n  excludeScrollbar: true\n};\nvar EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent, clickOutsideConfig);\n```\n\n## Regulating `evt.preventDefault()` and `evt.stopPropagation()`\n\nTechnically this HOC lets you pass in `preventDefault={true/false}` and\n`stopPropagation={true/false}` to regulate what happens to the event when it\nhits your `handleClickOutside(evt)` function, but beware: `stopPropagation` may\nnot do what you expect it to do.\n\nEach component adds new event listeners to the document, which may or may not\ncause as many event triggers as there are event listening bindings. In the test\nfile found in `./test/browser/index.html`, the coded uses\n`stopPropagation={true}` but sibling events still make it to \"parents\".\n\n## Marking elements as \"skip over this one\" during the event loop\n\nIf you want the HOC to ignore certain elements, you can tell the HOC which CSS\nclass name it should use for this purposes. If you want explicit control over\nthe class name, use `outsideClickIgnoreClass={some string}` as component\nproperty, or if you don't, the default string used is\n`ignore-react-onclickoutside`.\n\n## Older React code: \"What happened to the Mixin??\"\n\nDue to ES2015/ES6 `class` syntax making mixins essentially impossible, and the\nfact that HOC wrapping works perfectly fine in ES5 and older versions of React,\nas of this package's version 5.0.0 no Mixin is offered anymore.\n\nIf you _absolutely_ need a mixin... you really don't.\n\n### But how can I access my component? It has an API that I rely on!\n\nNo, I get that. I constantly have that problem myself, so while there is no\nuniversal agreement on how to do that, this HOC offers a `getInstance()`\nfunction that you can call for a reference to the component you wrapped, so that\nyou can call its API without headaches:\n\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport onClickOutside from 'react-onclickoutside'\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  // ...\n  handleClickOutside(evt) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  ...\n}\nvar EnhancedComponent = onClickOutside(MyComponent);\n\nclass Container extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.getMyComponentRef = this.getMyComponentRef.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  someFunction() {\n    var ref = this.myComponentRef;\n    // 1) Get the wrapped component instance:\n    var superTrueMyComponent = ref.getInstance();\n    // and call instance functions defined for it:\n    superTrueMyComponent.customFunction();\n  }\n\n  getMyComponentRef(ref) {\n    this.myComponentRef = ref;\n  }\n\n  render(evt) {\n    return <EnhancedComponent disableOnClickOutside={true} ref={this.getMyComponentRef}/>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that there is also a `getClass()` function, to get the original Class that\nwas passed into the HOC wrapper, but if you find yourself needing this you're\nprobably doing something wrong: you really want to define your classes as real,\nrequire'able etc. units, and then write wrapped components separately, so that\nyou can always access the original class's `statics` etc. properties without\nneeding to extract them out of a HOC.\n\n## Which version do I need for which version of React?\n\nIf you use **React 0.12 or 0.13**, **version 2.4 and below** will work.\n\nIf you use **React 0.14**, use **v2.5 through v4.9**, as these specifically use\n`react-DOM` for the necessary DOM event bindings.\n\nIf you use **React 15**, you can use **v4.x, which offers both a mixin and HOC,\nor use v5.x, which is HOC-only**.\n\nIf you use **React 15.5**, you can use **v5.11.x**, which relies on\n`createClass` as supplied by `create-react-class` rather than\n`React.createClass`.\n\nIf you use **React 16** or 15.5 in preparation of 16, use v6.x, which uses pure\nclass notation.\n\n### Support-wise, only the latest version will receive updates and bug fixes.\n\nI do not believe in perpetual support for outdated libraries, so if you find one\nof the older versions is not playing nice with an even older React: you know\nwhat to do, and it's not \"keep using that old version of React\".\n\n## IE does not support classList for SVG elements!\n\nThis is true, but also an edge-case problem that only exists for older versions\nof IE (including IE11), and should be addressed by you, rather than by thousands\nof individual libraries that assume browsers have proper HTML API\nimplementations (IE Edge has proper `classList` support even for SVG).\n\nIf you need this to work, you can add a shim for `classList` to your page(s),\nloaded before you load your React code, and you'll have instantly fixed _every_\nlibrary that you might remotely rely on that makes use of the `classList`\nproperty. You can find several shims quite easily, a good one to start with is\nthe [dom4](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4) shim, which adds all manner of\ngood DOM4 properties to \"not quite at DOM4 yet\" browser implementations.\n\nEventually this problem will stop being one, but in the mean time _you_ are\nresponsible for making _your_ site work by shimming everything that needs\nshimming for IE. As such, **if you file a PR to fix classList-and-SVG issues\nspecifically for this library, your PR will be closed and I will politely point\nyou to this README.md section**. I will not accept PRs to fix this issue. You\nalready have the power to fix it, and I expect you to take responsibility as a\nfellow developer to shim what you need instead of getting obsolete quirks\nsupported by libraries whose job isn't to support obsolete quirks.\n\nTo work around the issue you can use this simple shim:\n\n```js\nif (!(\"classList\" in SVGElement.prototype)) {\n  Object.defineProperty(SVGElement.prototype, \"classList\", {\n    get() {\n      return {\n        contains: className => {\n          return this.className.baseVal.split(\" \").indexOf(className) !== -1;\n        }\n      };\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## I can't find what I need in the README\n\nIf you've read the whole thing and you still can't find what you were looking\nfor, then the README is missing important information that should be added in.\nPlease [file an issue](issues) with a request for additional documentation,\ndescribing what you were hoping to find in enough detail that it can be used to\nwrite up the information you needed.\n"
